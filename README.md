Project Details:

Project Name: Predicting the disease(Diabetes)
Theme: 	Health and Safety	



Problem Statement / Objective: 
1.Prepare the data-set using several methods to train the model.
2.Build a model which can give accuracy of predicting the disease.


Solution To the Problem / Objective Stated:

•	Used to detect diabetes in medical
•	It can be helpful in pandemic situation when less doctors are available. 
•	Also it makes their work easier and faster.
•	It can be helpful in detecting patients on large scale.
•	It is available in very affordable price.
•	We have applied logistic regression analysis on the data set and finally predict the disease.


Description Of The Project:
•	Diabetes is a type of chronic disease which is more common among the people of all age groups. Predicting this disease at an early stage can help a person to take the necessary precautions and change his/her life style accordingly to either prevent the occurrence of this disease or control the disease (For people who already have the disease). 



Used libraries:
•	pandas
•	matplotlib.pyplot 
•	 sklearn.model_selection 
•	 train_test_split
•	 LogisticRegression
•	StandardScaler
